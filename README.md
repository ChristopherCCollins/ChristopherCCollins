Hello, I am Christopher C. Collins. I am a Computer Science: Software Systems graduate from the University of Tennessee Chattanooga. 

I am always looking to try new things, so if you would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me. If you would like access to any private repos from my previous account (PDQ278) that are not immediately visible, please go ahead and reach out to me as they were likely student projects that were privated at the request of professors, or work that I did for the University of Tennessee Chattanooga.

Thank you!
